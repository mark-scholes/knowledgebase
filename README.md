# Getting Started

Before starting, run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
Once the packages are installed, you can run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/\*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
